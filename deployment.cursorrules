# Deployment and CI/CD Rules

## Build Configuration
- Use Expo Application Services (EAS) for managed deployment pipeline
- Implement separate build configurations for development, staging, and production
- Use environment variables for API keys and configuration management
- Implement code signing and certificate management
- Use semantic versioning for app releases

## Continuous Integration
- Implement automated testing on pull requests
- Use GitHub Actions or similar for CI/CD pipeline
- Implement automated code quality checks and security scanning
- Use automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Implement performance regression testing

## Release Management
- Use staged rollout for new releases with gradual user exposure
- Implement feature flags for controlled feature deployment
- Use crash reporting and monitoring for release quality assessment
- Implement rollback procedures for problematic releases
- Maintain release notes and version documentation

## Monitoring and Analytics
- Implement crash reporting with Bugsnag or Sentry
- Use analytics to track user engagement and feature usage
- Monitor AI service performance and costs
- Implement user feedback collection and analysis
- Track key performance indicators for educational effectiveness

## Security and Compliance
- Implement certificate pinning for production API communications
- Use obfuscation for sensitive application logic
- Implement runtime application self-protection measures
- Maintain compliance documentation for educational privacy requirements
- Implement secure update mechanisms for AI models and content

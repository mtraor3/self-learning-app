# Testing and Quality Assurance Rules

## Testing Strategy
- Implement unit tests for all utility functions and business logic
- Use React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Implement integration tests for AI service interactions
- Use Detox for end-to-end testing on real devices
- Implement performance testing for AI processing features

## Code Quality Standards
- Maintain 90%+ test coverage for critical study features
- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Implement TypeScript strict mode with no implicit any
- Use Husky for pre-commit hooks with linting and testing
- Implement automated accessibility testing with accessibility testing tools

## AI Feature Testing
- Mock AI service responses for predictable testing
- Test AI feature graceful degradation scenarios
- Implement performance benchmarks for AI processing
- Test offline functionality for AI-dependent features
- Validate AI-generated content quality through automated checks

## Performance Testing
- Implement performance monitoring with Flipper or similar tools
- Test memory usage during document processing operations
- Validate 60fps animation performance on target devices
- Test battery usage during extended study sessions
- Implement crash reporting and analysis

## Security Testing
- Validate encryption implementation for user documents
- Test API security and authentication flows
- Implement penetration testing for data protection
- Validate secure storage implementation
- Test compliance with educational privacy requirements

## Device Compatibility
- Test on minimum supported device specifications
- Validate functionality across different screen sizes and orientations
- Test platform-specific features on both iOS and Android
- Implement automated testing on multiple device configurations
- Validate accessibility features across different devices and assistive technologies

## **5\. Problem Statement**

**Current Gap:** The study process is fundamentally broken for most students. They collect materials, create to-do lists, but lack the systematic approach needed to transform information into lasting knowledge. Existing solutions either provide content without structure (like NotebookLM) or structure without personalized content adaptation.

**Pain Points:**

Students experience analysis paralysis when facing large volumes of study material, leading to procrastination and eventual panic-driven cramming. Traditional study methods promote passive reading and highlighting without active recall, resulting in the "illusion of knowing" where students feel prepared but perform poorly on exams. The lack of spaced repetition scheduling means previously learned material is forgotten by exam time, requiring constant re-learning. Most importantly, students lack metacognitive awareness \- they don't know how to study effectively or recognize when their methods aren't working.

**Opportunity:** Create a bridge between educational psychology research and practical study execution. By combining document processing AI with behavioral psychology principles, we can automate the complex task of creating optimal study schedules while teaching users effective learning strategies they can apply beyond our platform.

## **Improved App Description**

**Core Vision**: An AI-powered study companion that transforms passive learning materials into personalized, active learning experiences through intelligent scheduling, spaced repetition, and adaptive content generation.

**The Problem You're Solving**: Students often struggle with the overwhelming task of converting raw study materials into effective learning schedules. They know what to study but not how to structure their learning for optimal retention. Many resort to cramming or passive reading, which leads to memorization rather than true comprehension.

**Your Solution Architecture**:

The app functions as an intelligent study orchestrator that takes multiple inputs \- syllabi, textbooks, notes, exam dates \- and creates a personalized learning journey. Think of it as having three core engines working together:

1. **The Planning Engine**: Analyzes uploaded materials and exam timelines to create optimized study schedules using spaced repetition algorithms and Pomodoro timing principles.  
2. **The Content Generation Engine**: Transforms passive materials into active learning experiences by generating practice questions, creating audio summaries (podcast-style), and identifying knowledge gaps.  
3. **The Progress Tracking Engine**: Monitors learning velocity, adjusts schedules based on performance, and provides feedback loops to reinforce successful learning patterns.

**Key Differentiators**: Unlike NotebookLM which focuses on document interaction, your app emphasizes behavioral change through structured learning habits. You're not just making information accessible \- you're making learning systematic and sustainable.

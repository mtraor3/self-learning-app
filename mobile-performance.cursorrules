# Mobile Performance Rules for Study Orchestrator

## Memory Management
- Implement proper cleanup for document processing components
- Use image optimization with appropriate compression levels
- Implement virtual scrolling for large document lists
- Release AI model memory when not in use
- Monitor memory usage during intensive operations

## Battery Optimization
- Use background app refresh sparingly for study reminders
- Implement efficient scheduling algorithms to minimize processing
- Optimize AI processing to use device neural engines when available
- Use push notifications instead of constant background polling
- Implement battery usage monitoring and user feedback

## Network Efficiency
- Implement smart caching strategies for offline-first functionality
- Use incremental sync for study progress and AI-generated content
- Compress document uploads and downloads
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests
- Provide clear indicators for network-dependent features

## Animation Performance
- Use native driver for animations whenever possible
- Implement 60fps animations for smooth user experience
- Use LayoutAnimation for automatic layout transitions
- Optimize list rendering with FlatList and optimization props
- Implement gesture-based interactions with React Native Gesture Handler

## Storage Optimization
- Use SQLite for structured study data and progress tracking
- Implement efficient file storage for documents and audio content
- Use compression for stored documents and AI-generated content
- Implement storage cleanup routines for old data
- Provide storage usage transparency to users

## Cross-Platform Considerations
- Use Platform-specific optimizations for iOS and Android
- Implement platform-appropriate navigation patterns
- Use native modules for performance-critical operations
- Test performance on various device specifications
- Implement platform-specific AI processing optimizations

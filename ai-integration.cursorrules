- Produce concept maps and visual learning aids
- Generate personalized flashcards from document content
- Create adaptive quiz questions based on performance data

## AI Response Handling
- Implement streaming responses for real-time content generation
- Use progressive disclosure for AI-generated content
- Provide confidence scores for AI-generated materials
- Allow user feedback and correction of AI outputs
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

## Performance Optimization
- Batch AI requests to reduce API calls and costs
- Implement request queuing for background processing
- Use compression for AI request and response data
- Cache frequently requested AI operations
- Monitor API usage and implement rate limiting

## Error Handling
- Provide graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
